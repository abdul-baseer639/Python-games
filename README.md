# ðŸŽ² Guess the Number Game (Python)

This is a simple Python game where the computer randomly chooses a number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess it.  
After each guess, the program will tell you whether your guess was too low or too high. The game continues until you guess the correct number, and it also shows how many attempts you took.
